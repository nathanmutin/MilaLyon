## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), such as heart attacks or coronary heart disease (MICHD), using machine learning techniques. By analyzing lifestyle and health-related factors, the model classifies individuals into two categories:

- **-1**: Low risk
- **1**: High risk

The project follows the complete data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and submission — and is part of the EPFL Machine Learning course.

## Dataset

The data originates from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which surveys U.S. residents about their health behaviors and chronic conditions.

The files provided are:

- **x_train.csv** — Training features (321 features, 328.135 samples)

- **y_train.csv** — Binary labels (+1 / -1) for training samples

- **x_test.csv** — Test features (109.379 samples)

- **sample-submission.csv** — Submission template (default all -1)

Respondents were classified as having MICHD if a health professional had diagnosed them or they had experienced a heart attack or angina.
